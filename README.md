# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create an analysis to convince investers that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, bike trip analysis examined the New York City Bike Program.

This analysis utilized Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype and import the transformed NYC Citibike dataset of 2,344,224 rows of data. Tableau was used to create a function to convert the "gender" column from an integer to a string, create a set of visualizations to analyze the data and dashboards and storyboard to display the results and analysis.
